## Short
Physics phenomena are described by partial differential equations. Solving these equations requires numerical methods, but they are computationally demanding and cannot meet the real-time constraints in virtual acoustics -- e.g., mixed reality, spatial computing, and metaverses -- where realistic physics simulations are crucial for creating immersive experiences. To address this challenge, we propose using deep neural operators to predict the pressure field in complex scenes within a fraction of a second for any combination of sound source and receiver positions. We have demonstrated the method's effectiveness in a dome measuring $36\text{ m}^3$, which includes intricate geometries. For the first time, a machine learning model can accurately predict the full-wave propagation in 3D, paving the way for future immersive experiences.
